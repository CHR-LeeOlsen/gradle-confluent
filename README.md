# Gradle Confluent Plugin
This is a Gradle Plugin for building and deploying content to the Confluent Platform. Unfortunately, I've been struggling to find time to write a proper README, but it's coming. Until then, you can refer to the [API documentation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/documentation.redpillanalytics.com/gradle-confluent/latest/index.html).

You can get this plugin from the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.redpillanalytics.gradle-confluent).
